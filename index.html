					Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:
				</h3>
				<ul class="list-disc flex flex-col items-start max-w-xl gap-6">
					<li>
						<strong>1914</strong>
						- Born in Cresco, Iowa
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1933</strong>
						- Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of
						Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as
						the "National Youth Administration"
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1935</strong>
						1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
						in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
						Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All
						of this left scars on me."
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1937</strong>
						- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry
						Service
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1938</strong>
						- Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off
						due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
						he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches
						him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1941</strong>
						- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor
						attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his
						lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
						disinfectants, and other applied science.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1942</strong>
						- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1944</strong>
						- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves
						behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a
						new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his
						team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent
						wheat - including different varieties for each major
						climate on Earth.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1945</strong>
						- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,
						doubling wheat yields
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1953</strong>
						- crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
						high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that
						responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95%
						of Mexico's wheat.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1962</strong>
						- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of
						wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help
						mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding
						population
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1980</strong> - helps seven African countries
						dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1983</strong> - becomes a distinguished
						professor at Texas A&M University
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double
						the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
						modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,
						as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
						inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
						modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
						before we called it science, people were selecting the
						best breeds."
					</li>
					<li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
